#Welcome to the official ModReq GitHub page.

###I am back!
Modreq is back in development. I am taking the time to refactor ModReq and
improve a lot of things with the knowledge I have now. The timeline of the
next release is unknown, but it will require a partially new config, 
database and messages file. This will be the 3.0 release for ModReq. Please
bear with me as I make ModReq ready for a new release.

###About ModReq
ModReq is a bukkit plugin designed to make the life of a moderator or admin
a lot easier. Every high ranked person knows that many people are always
spamming the chat to get your attention. ModReq will create a support Ticket
system for your bukkit server. If a person needs help, all he needs to do is
send a modreq via the /modreq <message> command. When the player submits the
ticket all online moderators and admins will receive a message about this. 
They can then do /check to receive a list of all open Tickets. They can also
claim a ticket by doing /claim <id> and start helping the person. Everyone
can check the status of their last five tickets by doing /status. They can 
also check the full message of one of their tickets by doing /status <id>
