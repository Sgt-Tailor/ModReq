# Welcome to the official ModReq GitHub page.

### I am back!
Modreq is back in development. I am taking the time to refactor ModReq and
improve a lot of things with the knowledge I have now. The timeline of the
next release is unknown, but it will require a partially new config, 
database and messages file. This will be the 3.0 release for ModReq. Please
bear with me as I make ModReq ready for a new release.
