Welcome to the official ModReq GitHub page.

ModReq is a bukkit plugin designed to make the life of a moderator or admin a lot easier. Every Hight ranked person knows that many people are always spamming the chat to get your attention. ModReq will create a support Ticket system for your bukkit server. If a person needs help, all he needs to do is send a modreq via the /modreq <message> command. When the player submits the ticket all online moderators and admins will receive a message about this. They can then do /check to receive a list of all open Tickets. They can also claim a ticket by doing /claim <id> and start helping the person. Everyone can check the status of their last five tickets by doing /status. They can also check the full message of one of their tickets by doing /status <id>
